# vscode-fish-text

With this extension you can generate the random text that is composed with the Soviet universal speech code. The text can be generated in Russian and English languages.

## Как пользоваться?

Use snippets `рыба` or `fish`. They add a three sentence text.

You can also put a number of sentences (up to 10) to the end of the snippet.

For the languages where HTML tags are used, you can use snippets `рыбатег` and `fishtag`. They generate the text pre-wrapped in the HTML tags (`<p>` by default).

Same works with Pug (Jade).

The list of languages where the snippets are available can be edited in the Settings.

## Why?

~~Why not?~~

This extension would be useful for Front End developers who want to quickly generate a text but want it to more meaningful than `lorem`.

There's also [the counterpart for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/fish-text) (it only supports the Russian text though).
